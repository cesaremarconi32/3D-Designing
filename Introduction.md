**Intro**
Welcome to my repository showcasing an exciting journey into the world of 3D designing for printing using TinkerCad. This repository contains my personal projects that explore the creative potential of 3D modeling and its practical applications in modern manufacturing and design.

**About TinkerCad & 3D Designing**

TinkerCad, an intuitive and user-friendly platform, has revolutionized the way we approach 3D design. By allowing both novices and professionals to create intricate models with ease, it opens up a world of possibilities in various fields including manufacturing, architecture, and hobbyist projects. Learning to use TinkerCad not only sharpens one's design and spatial reasoning skills but also provides a foundation for understanding complex CAD software, crucial in many engineering and design careers.

The skills and models showcased here have extensive applications. From prototyping in product development to architectural modeling, and from educational tools to custom hobbyist creations, the scope is vast. These projects exemplify how 3D design can bring ideas to life, providing a tangible glimpse into both practical and imaginative creations.

**GameBoy Color Model:**
